                <p>This studio began my journey into the depths of UI design. Utilizing Figma, I designed a new app 
                    that essentially serves the same purpose as Venmo... but for dogs. Instead of dollars, dogs can send 
                    bones to one another. Rather than invest in bitcoin, they have barkcoin! Overall,
                    this project allowed me to truly explore UI in an easy to use and accessible fashion. This project
                    was early in my UI career,
                    yet getting a taste of what I could potentially accomplish kept me committed to this journey 
                    and focused on becoming a better UI designer! Now, I understand that utilizing prototypes is an
                    extremely important part in design, so as to ensure that designs are not repetitive, promote
                    usability and memorability, and are accessible for everyone!

                <p>Here you can interact with the images above in a prototype that will allow you
                    to traverse through each page and see how they interact with each other! This kind
                    of easy-to-make and effective prototype truly highlighted how easy and important it 
                    is to prototype before design. From these methods, I could then tweak my designs to ensure
                    they were succinct, usable, and accessible for all.
