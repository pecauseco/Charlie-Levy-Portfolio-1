                <p> With this next project, I explored the value of the design process, emphasizing
                    the importance of critiques. Throughout this project, I had to present my designs
                    to a group critic as well submit my design to an online platform where real designers
                    in the UI industry could offer criticism and show us their thought patterns when interacting
                    with our site so that we could modify it. As with the other previous projects, this project
                    taught me to streamline all aspects of a site. The company we created a mock site for 
                    was Vendoo, a business focused on providing multitudes of information from various sites that 
                    sellers sell on. The main challenge here was finding how to oragnize the vast array of information
                    potential sellers would receive. As someone focused on efficency and how design most directly
                    correlates with that, I found this project engaging and believe this site could potentially
                    help sellers immensely.

                        <p>To start the process, every member developed three sketches each in a brainstorming session, designing different possible pages of the start up.

                        <p>After the best elements of each sketch had been chosen by our team, we then proceeded by creating Lo-Fi wireframes that encapsulated these designs. These wireframes allowed us to better visualize on a basic level, the structure of our interface which we were then able to translate into a Hi-Fi prototype.</p>

                    <p>The overall task we wanted users to complete was to check the trends of a singular item. We chose this task to see if it was intuitive to click on the image to get a closer picture of the item. The testing instructions and questions were as follows: </p>
                   
                    <p>After viewing the user testing videos the results of the testing were inline with our expectations. Most of the users when navigating to the trends page intuitively knew that clicking on the image of the shoe displayed a more in depth analysis of the trends. When thinking through their thought process and in the reflection all of the users like the site and felt that it was easy to navigate. One problem arose in our sign in subtask as one user struggled to figure out how to sign in. The user later on realized that they were signing into Figma and not our mockup site. There were no errors or issues on signing out as when they explored the website they all noted that the profile signed them out. Based on our UserTesting results and feedback the only change that we might make is making the sign in button bigger and bolder for the user to see on the home page.</p>
                    <p>Here are the user testing videos:</p>
