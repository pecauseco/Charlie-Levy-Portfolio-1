# Charlie-Levy-Portfolio-1
Welcome to my Front End Portfolio! After doing a variety of projects showcasing the Front End engineering process, I decided to compile them on a website of my own that would additionally showcase my design ability to display lots of material in a succinct and organized way. In this site I review four of my projects that each taught me about the process of design and implementation. From simple mock-ups with Figma, to a complex use of Javascript to organize colleges, each showed me an aspect of this dynamic world allowing me to be a better Front End Engineer going foward.

The link to the deployed site is: https://cooldog612.github.io/port/index.html
