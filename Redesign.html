                <h1 id="main-section-p2-header">Responsive Redesign</h1>
                <p>With this project, I attempted to redesign a wesbite that is commonly used to be more
                    accessible and provide a better user experience. The website I wanted to make more 
                    efficient was Island Packers Cruises', a company dedicated to serving the local
                    Southern California population by providing trips to and from the outlying Channel Islands.
                    From this project, I learned the importance of making a site usable. Before, the site made it
                    almost impossible to buy tickets; but, with my improvements the site was more inviting and 
                    gave users what they wanted faster. This positive connotation only arose out of the userface
                    and had nothing to do with the actual product being sold, going to show how powerful UI and UX
                    can be in creating how we perceive a business. I also learned sadly from this project that many
                    wesbites such as this one, are not very accessible for populations with disabilities, leading me
                    to want to focus my projects on not just streamlining and making sites more efficient, but also
                    on accessibility.

                <p>I chose this interface because I have had to use this website many times to go to this National Park and I constantly get confused by it. These islands have a special place in my heart due to the multitudes of fond memories I have from them from my youth, so helping to make the process of reaching them smoother for others is something I have passion for. First of all, the calendars for scheduling a trip are incredibly difficult to navigate because of how they are presented. The navigation bar is full of drop down menus that are highly inefficient, redundant, and present the information in an unituitive way. Most of all it is overwhelming. Furthermore, this site has no information whatsoever on each trip type, leaving users to not even understand what kind of trip they are buying. My goal is to streamline the website and provide users with information and the option to buy tickets on a well organized page. Interestingly, the Channel Islands National Park is one of the least visited National Parks in the country, and having a confusing and outdated website is not helping to assuage that problem in any way. Instead of formatting the page as such, it should be formatted with a page that provides information of each trip in a logical hierarchy and also allows them to buy tickets.
