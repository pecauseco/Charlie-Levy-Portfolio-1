                <p> The final project I have completed combined every aspect of each of the projects before.
                    With my new knowledge in the UI field I then attempted to create my own site that would 
                    help perform a function I'm familiar with all too well: applying to colleges. Much like with all the other
                    designs I have looked at, when you are applying to college you are bombarded with so much information.
                    This information comes in the form of requirements, application cycles, locations, size, etc. yet there 
                    truly is no site that will allow you to categorize and organize colleges in a streamlined way. That was
                    why I decided to take on this project as I feel dedicated to making hard processes easier by ensuring
                    everything is presented in the most easy way to navigate.
                </p>

                        <h1 id="main-section-p4-header">The Site</h1>
                        <p> With this site, you can filter, sort and add things to a cart simultaneously! Here you can see
                            how many essays a user will have to write, how each school's acceptance rate compares to the next,
                            requirements for applying, etc. As someone dedicated to being a UI UX designer focusing on 
                            streamlining complicated amounts of information, I designed this site to represent the amalgamation
                            of all of the principles the other projects taught me. For example, if you were to change the size 
                            of the page there would be responsiveness in the list of different schools. Furthermore, I asked
                            many other designers studying UI UX principles at Brown University if my original designs needed tailoring.
                            They provided vital feedback, such as telling me to have my cart at the side of the screen so users can look through
                            schools and their cart concurrently, rather than putting the cart under the list of colleges. Overall,
                            this project represents how UI UX designers can create a smoother experience for everyone in so many areas of life by just
                            creating an easy to use and streamlined interface!
